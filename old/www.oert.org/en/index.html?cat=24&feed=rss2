<blockquote><p>«Independent of what is said, a discourse can be analyzed in terms of some typical formal categories, of its order and specific function, and in its canonical structure. These schematic structures perform an important function, both in discourse production and comprehension, as well as in its storing and reproduction.» <cite>Aznar, E. y otros. <em>Coherencia textual y lectura.</em> Barcelona. ICE Horsori. 1991</cite></p></blockquote>
<h3>Journalistic communication</h3>
<p>Magazine design falls in a field between graphics journalism and journalistic communication. It is an integration process between individuals and social groups, and the message is its mediated form. Journalists, or editors, have the socially legitimated role to build social reality as a socially significant reality.  </p>
<p>The production of journalistic messages is part of their daily work and the media are the ones in charge of broadcasting those messages and of bringing together an audience and a text in what some authors call a media agreement or reading agreement (a new social agreement.) </p>
<p>The production, circulation and acknowledgment process implies the consensus that society provides to the media as a support which builds and broadcasts meaning over the world, and which is actually a specific case of human communication beyond the reductionist model S > M > R. Though journalism may be included within the basic canons of communication, considering it only the act of “communicating information”, would be minimizing its function, significance and importance. “Journalism is history’s minute hand”, the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer used to say. </p>
<p>The industry of information does not build a structurally homogeneous discourse but a complex group of genres and discursive modes. It is actually a systemic model, made up of a group of interacting elements in which a variation in any of them affects the whole group.</p>

<h4>Some characteristics</h4>
<p><em>The journalistic communication is subjective</em>: Apart from the each person’s subjectivity (based on his rules, values, experiences and impressions), the second essential fact that makes the journalism subjective is choice. On the one hand, the choice of certain words and specific syntax: for instance, it is not the same to say “The police crushed the demonstrators” than to say “The demonstrators were crushed by the police”. The first example is an active voice sentence, it is clear who the responsible agent of the actions is and who the recipient of the action is. The second example is a passive voice sentence, where the presence of the agent is relegated, diminished… and the direct object becomes the new subject of the sentence. </p>
<p>Another instance which accentuates subjectivity is that from the moment it is decided which information will be included in a medium and which one will be excluded, there is a journalist’s personal opinion as to where this information will be placed in the medium, which space it will occupy, whether or not it will include a picture, and if, what the picture will look like, what its title will be, aspects that will be stressed in it and from which point of view, among other elements. All these are choices made based on some subjective criteria and which show the journalist’s position as regards the event he is trying to inform about. </p>
<p><em>It is mediated</em>: what is published is not a reflection of reality. It is a construction made in the publishing offices based on the little or much information obtained, on a data obtained by the journalist after Consulting the sources and on the editorial line of the company. The journalist works in a very limited space: the publication’s frame. </p>
<p>Then, there is the interpretation each reader makes based on his own perception. Every journalistic creation may be considered as a global word, which the reader fills with meaning, based on his knowledge of language and personal experience. There is double subjectivity: that of the journalist when writing and that of the reader when reading. </p>
<p><em>It is intentional</em>: each medium’s purposes are countless. Its intentions may be varied, going from informative to recreational purposes, from suggestive to clearly commercial ones. They usually express explicit intentions but also implicit ones: ideological transmission is usually a common aspect to all types of edition. The journalistic message, apart from being a communicable fact, fulfills the formative function given the value judgments it presents. </p>
<p><em>It is not forced</em>: that is to say, it presupposes the reader’s participation and acceptance, which allows for different degrees of specification. This gives the publications freedom to move within different types of subject areas or with different degrees of commitment within one topic, and thus be able to satisfy more delimited audiences. </p>
<p><em>It is contextual</em>: ljournalistic texts result from a news event and share certain objective data, values and interpretation rules with their audience. This store of information they share is the context and it will allow for a specific text to get a unique interpretation among the several possibilities, or at least the one closest to the addresser’s original intention.</p>
<h3>Graphics journalism</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, in a magazine the following factors participate in communication:</p>
<ul>
<li>sender: writers (journalists- designers).</li>
<li>message: contents (information per se).</li>
<li>code: linguistic, graphic-typographic.</li>
<li>channel: the magazine (paper).</li>
<li>receiver: audience (readers).</li>
</ul>
<h4>The content</h4>
<p>Journalistically speaking, we may classify texts according to some of its own characteristics –discursive forms- which allow them to be framed within a specific genre.</p>
<p>Though some journalistic theorists show some differences in classification, the most characteristic types are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Informative texts: news, articles, interviews, chronicles, profiles.</li>
<li>Opinion texts: editorials, comments, reviews, columns, opinion articles, letters to the editor.</li>
<li>Others: short items, cartoons, horoscope.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The code</h4>
<p>Basically, magazines work with two types of codes: the linguistic or editorial one, related to the purpose of discourse (vocabulary and syntax used) and the graphic-typographic one which includes the typography(ies) with which the edition will be composed, whether it has images or not and if so, what kind of images, colors, etc.  </p>
<p>The selection of the code is closely related to the characteristics of the magazine’s most devoted readers. To their values and expressions. Both codes coexist in the same medium thus conforming a graphic-textual unit which interacts in an efficient way.</p>
<h3>Journalistic genres</h3>
<h4>The news</h4>
<p>It is the “objective” information about an event, without any kind of comment. It must be brief, concise and impersonal. When is an event considered a piece of news? When it is interesting for a large number of people, it is current and not usual, apart from other aspects, such as emotion, conflict, use or personality of the protagonist. </p>
<p>Structurally, the interest in a piece of news decreases. The most important fact is shown at the beginning. Usually, it is described as having an inverted pyramidal structure: decreasing order as regards the importance of the information.  </p>
<p>The text of a piece of news consists of the following elements: </p>
<ul>
<li>Headline: tells us what the news is about.</li>
<li>Introduction (lead paragraph): summarizes the piece of news; in it we find the answers to the basic questions: what?, who?, when?, how?, why?</li>
<li>Body: clarifies, qualifies and completes the information.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The interview</h4>
<p>The interview is the genre in which the journalist gets in touch with a public figure, the interviewee, on whom there is journalistic interest, due to his statements, to some event, to his position or just to his personality. Its purpose is to inform about a situation, an event, etc. An interview is not only the conversational moment between two speakers, but also the final text the journalist writes after that meeting. </p>
<p>The interview may be written following a chronological order and respecting the basic structure of questions and answers and it may also be written in as an account, in which case the order of questions and answers is not followed exactly as they occurred, and they are also not included in the text. We can find informative interviews and creative interviews. The informative interview is that which focuses on the statements of the celebrities, as they are the ones that contribute their grain to current affairs and justify its publication. The creative interview is that where the personal talents of the interviewer are involved: observation, environment, creation and recreation, world of repercussions and suggestions, more personal prose than foreign one. </p>
<p>As regards its structure, it may be variable, but the most frequent form is the one beginning with an indirect quotation, an interpretative assertion, a summary or, sometimes, a direct quotation. At the beginning of the article, generally in the first or second paragraph, the interviewee is revealed, its skills or authority in the subject matter of the interview are shown and its occasion and its importance are clarified. The body of the interview is a combination of direct and indirect quotations, mixed with transitional explanatory phrases or paragraphs. </p>
<p>Another technique for interview writing is to transcribe the questions and answers in the sequence they were made, or to select the opinion which is considered the most important one, beginning with it and then following the questions and answers order.<br />
In any case, the structure of the interview has three basic parts: </p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation or opening.</li>
<li>Development: questions, answers or the account.</li>
<li>Closing, which may be a comment, the final answer or the final part of the account.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The story</h4>
<p>The story is information about events that take place over a period of time told from the very place or near the place where they occurred by informant who was a protagonist, witness or investigator and who knows the circumstances around them.  </p>
<p>One of the characteristics of the chronicle is its regularity which allows a same author, a same topic or a same space of reference to be frequently repeated. This repetition ends up giving the reader of the story a feeling of familiarity between the writer and its audience. </p>
<p>We can differentiate chronicles which cover a place and chronicles which cover a topic. Within the chronicles written to inform about everything happening at a specific place are correspondent’s chronicles and special correspondent’s chronicles. Among them are those which are written according to the level of specialization the correspondent has about a specific topic, that is, legal, sports, events, society, parliamentary chronicles.</p>
<p>The length of the chronicle is a fixed one. It usually presents amazing variations and its limit may be established, as a last resort, by the space given by the newspaper. The structure of the chronicle the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation or opening.</li>
<li>The account, which includes details that allow the reader to “live” the event.</li>
<li>The conclusion, which is not a final judgment as there is no reasoning, but the end of the account.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the importance of knowing the macrostructures of each type of text lies in the possibility of being able to graphically encode such structures, by giving its different parts a hierarchical order, to make its reading and interpretation visually more comprehensible.</p>

Relation between form and content.
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="autor">Created by: Pablo Cosgaya, Natalia Pano</p>
<p class="note">Artículo en proceso de traducción </p>
<p>Graphic resources (newspapers, magazines, fascicles) are partial records of our culture with a certain degree of temporal and spatial relativity. These publications reproduce renewable information and content: they are updated in a specified period of time (daily, weekly, bimonthly, monthly, etc.).</p>
<p>Thus, regular publications must have an initial layout when the time for launching it comes. This layout will be a pattern, a base structure in which the graphic constants that will characterize the publication will be defined.</p>
<p>These graphic constants are: typographic palette, text color, type size, leading, capitulars, miscellanies, frames, margins. When these graphics, typographic and, eventually, photographic elements, are brought together and combined in a certain way so as to meet specific functions, they help define a distinctive code.</p>
<p>An initial layout is designed at the beginning of the project, and all decisions are taken based on it. In most cases, layouts experience changes throughout time: the application of the elements constantly redefines it.</p>
<p>Journalistic sections (world, country, general information, society, sports, etc.) are spatially organized in the publication based on a structure, which is usually another publication constant. Articles that do not belong to a specific section must have a relation with the rest, but setting themselves apart from it at the same time. As it may be seen, a subtle game of constants and variables is put to test in each case.</p>
<p>Regular publications have a constant structure that allows the reader to follow his own reading itinerary. Certain graphic elements allow the reader different quick entries to the page: the title, the pictures, the epigraphs. Also the banner, the section headline, the highlights in the body of the article. They are elements that catch the reader’s eye before the text itself and which suggest different navigations depending on the user’s interests.</p>
<p>Navigation resources make reading smoother and contribute to establishing the hierarchy of the content. This meets the needs specific to regular publications, which, given their dimensions, topic diversity and number of pages require a type of organization suggesting different paths for reading, depending on the interests of each reader. Thus, a reader will only search for general ideas, and other may stop and go deep into the news.</p>
<h3>Texts edition (graphics resources)</h3>
<p>Titling resources are: the opening strip, the banner, the title or headline, and the sub header, lead or summary. Apart from how each reader navigates the piece, the combination banner/title/sub header is articulated as an informative unit. That is, all three together state, place and develop the essential article data. For this, every element in this unit must be seen as an essential complement to the other two: they must not repeat information. At the same time, titling criteria must be coherent throughout the whole publication: they constitute a style.</p>

</div>
</h5>
<h5>Heading (1)</h5>
<p>Element which unifies a topic when its development demands more than one page. Brief statement that anticipates the kind of event specified in the other events of the titling.</p>
<h5>Title (2)</h5>
<p>It must clearly state the event, even in the case of topics that are subject to monitoring over certain periods of time. Its originality and clarity establish its quality.</p>
<h5>Banner (3)</h5>
<p>It places, anticipates and/or contextualizes the information in the title. It is a thematic definition which in many cases adds information. It may be read right after the title, but it is not mandatory to have it. Its main attributions are: accuracy and clarity. Several newspapers give priority to essential information, use short sentences, and avoid subordinations and allusions.</p>
<h5>Sub header (4)</h5>
<p>It develops the essential information and, thus, it has a relation of reading continuity with the title, regardless of how the reader navigates the piece. In several newspapers it consists of short statements, not necessarily related with each other. These statements allow for syntactic continuity even though phrases are separated by a period. The function of the sub header is to support and feed the title. To contextualize, to arrange the information, to break it down into specific data. In some cases it becomes a summary of what is offered to the reader in the text of the main article. We must avoid sub headers that refer to secondary elements or that draw attention away and affect reading direction.</p>
<h3>Other elements for quick reading</h3>
<p>Apart from the resources we have already explained, there are other types of elements that help process the information of a regular publication. These are the epigraph, highlights, subordinated notes, tables and summaries.</p>
<h5>Epigraph (5)</h5>
<p>It may be one of the first things the reader sees in the page and its importance is the same as that of the titling elements. It must be clear and accurate. It refers to the picture and adds information; it must not repeat the information in the title, banner or subheading. It must not say what is obvious in the picture.</p>
<p>Instead, it provides the data necessary to clarify what is shown in the picture. These data include names, or information about the people in the picture, a description of the recorded events, or an explanation of anything that is not clear in the picture and any relevant information that may improve that provided by the image (date, place&#8230;).</p>
<h5>Highlight</h5>
<p>It is an element located in the middle of the article, and its main function is to make reading smooth and to highlight information nuclei. Keeping in mind that the reader may superficially scan the article and read only the highlights, their production requires attention and care.</p>
<h5>Subordinated notes, tables and summaries</h5>
<p>The content of these resources requires in many cases a subsequent elaboration from the basic text. The soundness of its information allows the publisher or editor to extract this text from the main article and adjust its dimension as needed. The presence of these resources and the coherence of their graphic aspect allow them to be used for balancing the design, for compensating empty spaces. Thus, the goal is that their height or width mach the elements they accompany: pictures, other tables, boxes, etc.</p>
<p>In spite of these elements, the editorial structure will be empty if it is not referenced to a specific code. Let’s keep in mind that it will be not only a graphic code: On one hand, the formal representation system requires specific and appealing strategies and answers, which grant identity to each publication. On the other hand, journalistic criteria, ideological approach and language used to get to the reader will also shape that identity.</p>
<p>s designers, we may act as a link between the parties at stake: we may suggest how to read the articles. We can design based on the pictures, the illustrations, or a mixture of both, by associating content in a specific context and reflecting it trough visual image. The department of design contributes to the balance of the editorial project. It is our task to focus on making information simple for the reader and making the structure of the publication he has in his hands as clear as possible. Once he is about to read it, we must help him go further into each article and catch his interest in its content by using clear presentations, with parts in a proper hierarchical order. Editorial design and the typography are indivisible from the information they present and organize. To think of design as a pure form, dissociated from content, is nonsensical.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Order and space. The typographic grid as a tool for design and communication. Line spacing as modulation unit. Construction of the typographic grid: vertical and horizontal modulation. Legibility and modulation. 
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="autor">Revisión: Natalia Pano</p>
<p class="note">Artículo en proceso de traducción </p>
<blockquote><p>«Order is the logic of design and it is controlled by space. The organization of this space is a key for both legibility and visual aspect of a graphic piece». <cite>Martin Solomon</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>During the process of building and receiving a message, relations between time and space are established.  In a composition, ordering the elements on the plane based on rules of proportion gives the piece a specific rhythm and coherence. This is used by the designer as a tool for establishing visual hierarchies and to clearly express his communicative intention.  Modulating the space has nothing to do with an esthetic or stylistic whim. Modulation is a resource of smart and useful design which allows for solving complex communication problems in a multiple and diverse way. And which also assures the unity and the harmonious behavior of the elements used. </p>
<p>When we think about a printed edition, be it is a newspaper, magazine, annual report, or other publication to be read, space must be modulated bearing in mind that most of the times we will be working with texts, thus, we will build a reticle or grid on the basis of typographic criteria. </p>
<p>To that end, the basic element to consider is the leading with which the main text will be composed. </p>
<p>This leading will be the structural unit of our typographic reticle or grid.  </p>
<p>To begin with the task of modulating space according to typographic criteria, there are two different procedures that may be tried out:</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>. One, we may consider a preconceived idea or a draft showing the characteristics of the printed area and its position on the page. So as to be able to make this draft, we must know all the information as to the text and images to be included in the piece. Besides, we must have a clear idea about how we want to organize this information so it is well received. Thus, taking the draft as a starting point, we perform a modulation that allows adjusting its proportions.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>. We may make a modular structure without any preconceived idea. This means that, previously, we will divide the working space to the most, trying to get a rich enough and versatile grid so as to allow different alternatives for its use. Then, we will perform the page layout.</p>
<p>There is not a single method for designing a grid, since, as we have already said, this depends on each designer’s experience and needs and on each specific piece. However, in order to explain the problem, we will resort to a basic system. </p>
<p>To that end, we have to divide the page vertically &#8211; division by fields from top to bottom- as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>. First, we must decide the basic leading we will use in our work, based on what the main text requires. Then, we will find out how many lines fit in the height of the format using that leading.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>. Once we have obtained that number, we will in turn divide the page into 2, 3, 4 fields, etc., subtracting in each case the river that separates them.<br />
For instance:<br />
47 &#8211; 1 = 46 / 2 = 23 lines<br />
47 &#8211; 2 = 45 / 3 = 15 lines<br />
47 &#8211; 3 = 44 / 4 = 11 lines<br />
47 &#8211; 4 = 43 / 5 = does not allow an exact division<br />
47 &#8211; 5 = 42 / 6 = 7 lines<br />
47 &#8211; 6 = 41 / 7 = does not allow an exact division<br />
47 &#8211; 7 = 40 / 8 = 5 lines<br />
47 &#8211; 5 = 42 / 9 = does not allow an exact division</p>
<p>We understand, then, that the first number corresponds to the whole number of lines in the length to be divided, the second to the subtracted rivers, the fourth to the number of fields and the last one to the result or number of lines per field.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. Once we have analyzed the modulation possibilities given the leading we have chosen, we will use the result of the division that is most convenient for the purposes of the design (a). </p>
<p>As regards the head and bottom margins, they will be determined taking into consideration one or more fields of the division traced, bearing in mind the concepts developed in previous lessons (b). Once the partition has been made, we will define horizontal modulation based on the requirements of the design. If apart from the main text (how many columns will compose it?) we have other ancillary texts &#8211; notes, references, quotes, etc. &#8211; this should be considered when making this division. </p>
<p>To move on to horizontal modulation—division by fields from left to right- we will measure the whole page and we will proceed in the same way as we did for vertical division. Once we achieve field division, we will take full advantage of it, so as to obtain a dynamic work, which may contribute to communication by arranging its elements inside a coherent unit (c).</p>
<h3>Modulation within the column</h3>
<p>Once we have defined the basic modulation, we may need to include even smaller spatial subdivisions, an issue which is quite frequent when working with columns and tables, thus it is usual to resort to tabulation. </p>

<p>Tabulation is an operation that affects at least a whole paragraph and consists of the following steps: a) select paragraph/s for  tabulation, b) select «tabulation attributes» from the corresponding program menu, c) in the dialog box, select the tabulation type needed, d) indicate the spatial location of the tabulation in the width of the line and e) if necessary, a «filling» character for the tabulation space may be indicated. </p>
<p>So as to maintain coherence with the rest of the publication, tabulation should respect the modulation criteria already presented. Thus, a good method is to tabulate keeping the minimal structural unit from our grid: the leading in the main text.</p>

<h3>Considerations about legibility</h3>
<p>From the moment we chose the leading we are going to work with, we must know which type size works better with that leading. When deciding the column width we will work with, we must keep in mind that type sizes that are too big (over 12 pt, depending on the family) or too small (less than 9 pt, depending on the family) are difficult to read and that a line of text must contain around ten words (depending on the editorial.) </p>
<p>The length of a line of text must be such that when we are done reading it, the beginning of the next line may be found. If excessively short, the change of line interrupts the regular reading rhythm and ends up tiring the reader. </p>
<p>Titles, subtitles, notes, etc., will act as multiples or submultiples of the type size used in the main reading text, either keeping the same leading or adopting a multiple of the previous one.</p>

<p class="note">Artículo en proceso de traducción </p>
<h3>The book as a seducing object</h3>
<p>A book is a block (or book-block) bound with endpapers to covers which are separately produced. The book pages may be printed or not and the method used for binding them may be sewing or gluing them. The type of binding and the materials used for it and the thickness of the book in relation to the size and proportions of the page, will most certainly affect the qualities of the object and, thus, the global impression it will produce. </p>
<p>The «packaging» of the text, will also modify how it will be read. The substrate affects the relation the reader will establish with the text. A newspaper is not read the same way as a book. A novel in newspaper format would make its reading less pleasant.  </p>
<p>As regards typography, these aspects are not irrelevant. For instance, whether the publication is glued or sewed will influence the size of the gutter margin, and this will influence the correct or difficult visualization of the block of text. </p>
<h3>Books typology</h3>
<p>The book, as a useful object, is determined by the human touch and sight. This sets certain basic parameters as regards its format, thickness and weight. Besides, the book format is defined by the traditions or trends in each period, by paper formats and by the printer, but fundamentally by its nature or purpose.<br />
<a href="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/T04D_01-machas-texto_01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1399" title="Diferentes tipos de texto y sus correspondientes manchas tipográficas" src="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/T04D_01-machas-texto_01.jpg" alt="Diferentes tipos de texto y sus correspondientes manchas tipográficas" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<p>What is the purpose of classifying books? The following categories described, which are by no means absolute nor the only ones, help us divide a broad field of knowledge as to proportions which are easily handled and provide us with a criteria for analysis, to deal with book design.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/T04D_tipodelibros1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1400" title="Tipos de libros" src="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/T04D_tipodelibros1.jpg" alt="Tipos de libros" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<h4>Prolonged reading books (novels and short stories)</h4>
<p>In these cases, the format should be easy to handle, relative small and narrow (it should be possible to hold them with only one hand) The paper should be soft, flexible and not too heavy. Also, the color should not be blindingly white. A legible fond type and wide enough interword space and leading (neither too narrow, nor too wide) should be chosen. As to the number of characters per line, 45 to 60 is an ideal quantity. It is advisable to use indentation so that paragraphs may be easily differentiated. As to page layout, avoid widows and orphans. Space may be gained or lost when lines are rearranged. We must try to avoid register from being altered by this, i.e., the lines should be consistent throughout the pages. </p>
<h4>Poetry</h4>
<p>They behave the same way straight texts do, as regards handling and legibility, but its distribution per pages is more complex as poetry favors a visually fragmented textuality.  </p>
<p>Usually, the space left between the title and the poem itself should have slight variations. To achieve a balance in double-page spread, the poem is usually optically centered in relation to the midfield of the type page. The more uneven the poem verses are, the more complicated this is to achieve. In such case, the book designer must respect line breaks, indentations and lines that begin with capitals and lower case as stipulated by its author. </p>
<h4>Theater: Scripts</h4>
<p>They will have to be treated differently depending on whether they are plays for classical or experimental theater. In any case, clarity must be maintained using typographic resources to mark the hierarchies and sequences of the reading and thus avoid interpretation ambiguities. </p>
<h4>Illustrated literature </h4>
<p>They demand a close cooperation between the illustrator and the typographer. It is necessary for image and text to be conceived as a single entity. Frequently, typography must be fitted into the illustrations and vice versa. They must relate to each other in the best possible way. Some resources to achieve this are: harmony, contrast, size, position, color value.</p>
<h4>Art books</h4>
<p>The sizes and proportions of the reproductions must be big enough so as to be able to appreciate their details. Thus, this type of books is usually considerably big. A reader, sitting in a chair with the book on the table, should be able to see the whole image at a glance. Whichever the book format is, the size of the text should adjust to the reading distance.</p>
<h4>Informative or divulgation books</h4>
<p>They have pictures, sketches, diagrams. They have the same problems text and illustration books have. It usually happens that the text and the image have the same importance. However, images should neither be as big as those in art books nor as small as those in a text book.</p>
<h4>Scientific</h4>
<p>The learned work, aimed at readers whose time is precious, has multiple tabular references: division in volumes, chapters, sections, explanatorily pages, introductory summaries, analytical table of contents, proper names index, appendixes, bibliography. Inside there are paragraphs, tables, formulas, color and black-and-white illustrations (pictures, drawings, maps, diagrams), epigraphs, footnotes, etc. In these books it is highly important to achieve the distinction between different parts and different elements by means of different visual resources. </p>
<h4>Reference Books</h4>
<p>It is the case of dictionaries, encyclopedia, travel guides, museum guides, etc. The user looks for a specific key word. Typography must be adapted so that he may find what he is looking for when scanning the page (generally in a vertical direction.) They are not non-stop reading materials, though there are cases where an entry can take up several columns or pages. Thus, special attention must be paid to text details and appeal once again to every resource available to achieve differentiation.</p>
<h4>School books</h4>
<p>As this is reading for kids and it is also compulsory, it has to be specially clear and it requires special care as to typography so as to make it attractive and motivational to read. Appealing to the use of shapes, colors, typography, images, miscellany, grid areas and spaces, we may make reading more enjoyable and interesting. All these elements must be in line with each other and be solidly applied so that different text levels can be perceived and differentiated at a quick glance: main text, highlights, comments, exercises. </p>
<h4>Children’s books</h4>
<p>They could consist of only illustrations, with very little or just some text, depending on whether they are for beginners or advanced readers, pre-adolescents, etc. Usually, it is illustration what predominates, and the text is worked as visual material, with blocks that are linked to the illustrations, along the surface of the page. Big type sizes are used, as they are sources of good legibility (good separation between characters, good leading.) As the reader becomes more skilled, the type size may be reduced.  </p>
<p>Frequently, children’s books do not have pagination: the child would not know what to do with it, considering that these books are aimed to be looked at from end to end or contemplated for its images. </p>
<h4>Collector’s books (deluxe)</h4>
<p>Frequently they are no longer functional objects and become pieces of art. In them, text and image coexists. The main difference with other types of books is the use of luxury materials and procedures (papers, binding, special inks, printing methods) and the generous use of space. Very few copies are printed and the price is often high. </p>
<h3>Integral design</h3>
<p>Whatever the design principle followed may be, all the components of the book must equitably rest on an unified plan, so that elements which are the same may be treated in the same way from the first to the last page.  </p>
<p>Titles and subtitles, the space below the beginning of the chapter, leading, among other aspects, are signs which inform and help transmit the desired atmosphere, while performing specific functions (indicate hierarchy) within the book.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="autor">Created by: Pablo Cosgaya. Adapted “Principios de formación”, in Manual de diseño editorial, by Jorge de Buen Unna.</p>
<blockquote><p>«The body of a piece must have an organization, and this has to be obvious for the reader from the very moment he gets in touch with the book». <cite>Jorge de Buen Unna,<em> Manual de diseño editorial</em></cite></p></blockquote>
<p class="note">Artículo en proceso de traducción </p>
<p>The first task an editorial designer has to undertake is reading the piece, to get to know its content, understand its structure and prefigure the parts in which it is organized. The four main parts of a book are: covers, beginnings, body of the work and endings. We have already discussed in a previous paper how each of these parts is composed, but we are going to stop here in the main body of the piece.</p>
<p>The designer must know the levels of importance that need to be visually solved throughout the main body (opening of chapters, titles, subtitles, main text.).</p>
<p>The main body of the piece is,<br />
basically, an arranged succession of chapters. Each chapter in time consist of several articles (groups of paragraphs joined under the same title.) Thus we conclude that the paragraph is the structural part of the piece.</p>
<h3>Paragraphs</h3>
<p>When texts were written one line after the other, as a continuum, the beginnings of new ideas or concepts were indicated by a paragraph mark or some other ornament, usually painted in red. In the Middle Ages the usage of beginning each paragraph in a separate line was adopted, but the practice of beginning each one of them with a paragraph mark was maintained.</p>
<p>The use of a paragraph mark at the beginning of the paragraph, as well as illuminations and binding, used to be made outside the copy room (and then, outside the printing office.) With time, it became customary to leave the paragraphs without illumination (without its initial paragraph mark), exactly as they came out of the printing office. This is how the common paragraph became what we know today.</p>
<h4>Regular paragraph (justified)</h4>
<p>It is composed by indenting the first line and composing lines of the same width leaving the last line shorter, left-aligned. This creates well defined text rectangles, but special attention should be paid to hyphenation at the end of each line to achieve a uniform typographic color.</p>
<p>Paragraphs do not need to be separated one from the other by a blank line, as indentation shows the beginning of a new paragraph. The size of common indentation is an em, i.e., the space it occupies is the same as the type size in which the text is composed.</p>
<h4>Modern or German paragraph (justified)</h4>
<p>Before the Second World War, many designers, lead by Jan Tschichold, began a movement known as New Typography, characterized by a total rejection to ornaments. This idea was reintroduced by the «Swiss school» (lead by Josef Müller Brockmann), by the middle of last century. This line of thought was based on the regular paragraph, but considered indentation as superfluous, arguing that the final short line was already enough to indicate that the paragraph had ended. With time, the idea was supplemented by adding a blank line between paragraphs, to make separation more evident; this is a variation of the modern paragraph known as separate paragraph.</p>
<p>When this type of solutions is applied to lengthy pieces of work they increase the number of pages, as compared to the regular paragraph composition. It also produces a higher frequency of widows and orphans. In case this type of paragraphs is adopted, it is not necessary for the first line to begin with indentation, because the blank line between paragraphs is already enough to differentiated them.</p>
<h4>Broken, unjustified or one-side justification paragraph (flush left)</h4>
<p>They are made up of lines aligned on the left-hand side with the right-hand side ragged. The distribution of space between letters and between words is normally produced and an even color is achieved, though the right end is not smooth. This type of composition hides the typographer’s ignorance, but it does cause some inconveniences: it is necessary to avoid the repetition of words or fragments at the beginning of each line, the existence of whimsical o appealing forms on the right end of the paragraph and the coincidence of two or more lines of the same length, to mention a few. To achieve a more elegant look with this type of paragraph, it is advisable to use hyphens at the end of each line.</p>
<h4>Hanging paragraph</h4>
<p>This type of paragraph is used to make up listings and dictionaries. It consists of indenting the whole paragraph, except for the first line (the exact opposite of the regular paragraph.) To achieve this effect in desktop publishing programs, an indentation value is indicated for the whole text and the same value, but negative, is indicated for the first line.</p>
<h3>Other types of paragraph composition</h3>
<p>We have described the most common types of paragraphs. However, other types have been used throughout history, which are convenient to know: epigraphic or pine shaped (centered in all its lines), shaped (variation of the previous one which adjusts the length of each line to achieve a specific shape), old-style (without a line break and with a paragraph mark at the beginning of each paragraph.)</p>
<h3>Asymmetry and symmetry</h3>
<p>Given the fact that in our language we read from left to right, typographic composition is by definition asymmetric. This implies that regardless of whether the paragraph is placed on an even or on an odd page, the reader will always read it in the same way.</p>
<p>It is a common mistake to set flush left paragraphs on even pages and set flush right paragraphs on odd ones. The main text should always be composed in the same way, regardless of the page where it is located. Once we understand this general principle, we should consider that other elements such as titles, headings and page numbers can be symmetrically arranged.</p>
<h3>Paragraph attributes</h3>
<p>Once we have decided on the characteristics of the paragraphs for the main text, it is advisable to configure this paragraph only once and to save those settings in the Style Palette of the desktop publishing program used.</p>
<h4>Discretionary or soft hyphens</h4>
<p>Commonly, adjusting paragraphs requires breaks which may vary throughout the treatment of the text. Very often there are hyphens which were left in a word which is part of a text which flowed. To avoid this, we may take advantage of a useful resource of the desktop Publishing programs: the discretionary or «soft» hyphen, which consists on the combination of the hyphen key [-] with another (in QXP-MacOS: Command + Hyphen, in QXP-Win: Ctrl + Hyphen), and as a result, when the text flows the hyphen disappears.</p>
<h4>Discretionary or Soft Line Breaks</h4>
<p>The same thing mentioned in the previous item happens with line breaks (in QXP-Mac: Shift + Enter, in QXP-Win: Shift + Enter.) This commands allow you to make a line break without modifying the paragraph attributes to which they belong.</p>
<h3>Brief Glossary</h3>
<p><strong>Composition</strong><br />
Words and spaces joined together to make up words, lines, and columns. In the beginnings of printing, this was hand made, choosing the letters and spaces in the type case as quickly and accurately as possible, and passing them to a metal composing rule: the composer stick.</p>
<p><strong>Space</strong><br />
Element used to separate letters and words from each other. In the traditional printing, spaces are made of different sizes: narrow, mid, thick, half an em, em, em an a half, two, three and four ems.</p>
<p><strong>Letter-spacing (horizontal spacing) </strong><br />
Amount of space between neighboring letters. It is enlarged or reduced to make the lines in a paragraph have the exact same length.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong><br />
Operation which consists of applying tracking to text in a paragraph so that all lines may have the exact same length.</p>
<p><strong>Orphan line</strong><br />
The first line of the paragraph when it appears at the end of a column.</p>
<p><strong>Widow line</strong><br />
The last line of the paragraph when it appears at the beginning of a column. This line is unsightly and should be avoided by shortening the paragraph to which it belongs or going through the text. In the desktop publishing programs there is the possibility of configuring it to keep the first two or the last two lines of the paragraph together. Thus widows and orphans can be easily noticed, and may then be corrected.</p>

<p class="bajada">A book is a reflection of the culture of a nation, its people, a time. It represents all the cultural values of the men who are part of its history. It is ultimately the silent witness which persists regardless of generations.</p>
<p>The designer has one responsibility towards the author, its text and then towards the hidden client, i.e., the reader, since only by putting them in touch a direct or editorial service to the client will be provided. In editorial design the process goes from the inside to the outside: first, the inner content is adequately planned, and then the external wrapping will be its logical consequence. Several difficulties will then have to be overcame in the various parts of the book, which, though different parts of the same edition, must work as a whole. Each page will be treated in its usual order of appearance, in relation to the book as a whole.</p>
<p>There is a tradition as regards how each page of the book is treated and the order in which they are arranged; though at the same time there is freedom when dealing with a new problem of editorial design.</p>
<h5>Book edges</h5>
<p>Every book has three edges, the top or head, the bottom or tail and the fore edge which is the one opposite to the spine. The fore edge may be flat (if so is the spine) or take a concave shape when the spine is round. This shape is called <em>double rule.</em></p>

<h5>Book cover</h5>
<p>It makes the book dignified, as when covering it, it grants it the typical characteristics of the typography and of the binding. It is a precious place for true personality features; it is the consequence of the book internal design.<br />

<p>The spine of the book is part of the cover, and its purpose is to make it easier to find the edition in the shelves of a bookcase. It may include the author’s name, the title of the piece, the corresponding volume number in a collection and data regarding the publisher (who organizes, maintains, produces and distributes books, newspapers, magazines or other instruments of editorial communication.)</p>
<p>Special attention should be paid to the elements that make up the spine, the reading direction (horizontal, ascending vertical or descending vertical), legibility, type size, its relation with the rest of the title, etc.</p>
<h5>Jacket</h5>
<p>It is the wrapping designed to protect the book cover. Its characteristics are closely related to the cover.</p>
<p>In our consumer society, the jacket has become an example of advertising means, so they include images and huge size typography.</p>
<h5>Endpapers</h5>
<p>They are sheets of paper which the bookbinder places folded in half to bind the book to the cover. Generally, they are of a paper different than that used in the body of the book, both in grammar and color.</p>
<h5>Flyleaf</h5>
<p>It is a white sheet placed at the beginning and at the end of the book. On deluxe or special editions, they are two o more flyleaves.</p>
<h5>Title Page</h5>
<p>It was first used to protect the true title page from getting dirty and it was also useful to identify the book.</p>
<p>It is the first printed page of the book, and it normally includes only the title (if it is a collection, the title and publisher of the collection), and from which pagination (which is not printed) of the preliminaries begins.</p>

</div>

<p>The title page with the copyright page make a confronted double page. In the beginning, the copyright page was an engraving often printed in a separate process (intaglio, steel engraving, chromolithography) and inserted by the bookbinder confronting the title page.<br />
<a href="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/T04B_portada.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1420" title="Portada" src="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/T04B_portada.jpg" alt="Portada" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<p>Little by little, if became acceptable to include in this page a list with other titles by the same author or books of the same collection. If a better use of this copyright page is not found, it is better to leave this page blank, with the title page devised as a self-sufficient design.</p>
<p>The title page is the main entrance to the book. It was a poster, a door and many other things before the endpaper and the flap appeared and shared the burden of attracting the crowds. The title page shows the topic of the book and how it is organized throughout the layout. The lines that appear in that page are information units introduced in a visual manner and as such they are not subject to the grammar rules of sentence structure and punctuation.</p>
<p>The information includes the title of the book (also the subtitle, if any), the name of the author and publisher and the number of illustrations it contains, if this information is relevant for the edition. The designer establishes a hierarchy for each element and assigns it a value, for example, determines the author’s category or the importance of a subtitle in relation to the title, before thinking about possible type sizes and type face families, as well as the grouping, order and refurbishment of those elements in the page.</p>
<h5>Legal or credit page</h5>
<p>It is made up of the text which due to regulatory reasons appears at the back of the title page and which has become larger in the last years.</p>
<p>Legally speaking, the following information must be included: publication information not mentioned before, edition number, translators, illustrators, photographers, designers and other collaborators which took part in the edition. Copyright, intellectual property right (an international convention sets the terms and duration of such property; publishers of the countries which recognized it must indicate this in the publication, with the symbol ©, the day of publication and the name of the copyright owner), the isbn (International Standard Book Number), created by initiative of the unesco, and which numerically codifies the country of edition, the publisher and the subject matter of the book.</p>
<h5>Dedication</h5>
<p>Nowadays, personal dedications usually occupy the first odd page after the title page, though frequently the even page facing the text is considered as an alternative the idea is not to waste space.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/T04B_dedicatoria.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1422" title="Dedicatoria" src="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/T04B_dedicatoria.jpg" alt="Dedicatoria" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<h5>Acknowledgments</h5>
<p>From both the author as the editor for the people who collaborated in the compilation or edition of the material.</p>
<h5>Prologue</h5>
<p>It is a complimentary note from an authority on the subject. It must be placed in the preliminary pages.</p>
<h5>Preface</h5>
<p>Text where the author explains its reasons for writing the book, and which may include the acknowledgments; it should be placed after any prologue and before the introduction.</p>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>It is an account of the topics, objectives, structure and conventions of the book, it is indivisible from the text and it constitutes its opening chapter.</p>
<h5>Contents</h5>
<p>The table of contents reflects the structure of the book. It describes the chapters or main divisions of a book in brief. An analytic table of contents can be included at the end of the book where the proper names and the most important concepts are enumerated, alphabetically arranged and also a table of contents describing the visual material included in the book.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/T04B_indice.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1421" title="Índice" src="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/T04B_indice.jpg" alt="Índice" width="700" height="525" /></a></p>
<h5>Abbreviations</h5>
<p>They are symbols or other signs containing special information that allow for the understanding of the text.</p>
<p>Here, the errata may be included, where the errors and mistakes in the book may be clarified and corrected.</p>
<h5>Titles of parts and chapters</h5>
<p>They are communication tools established from the title page towards the text, and which continue within the text, in a descendant order, with the headlines, epigraphs, sub epigraphs, etc.</p>

<h5>Headings</h5>
<p>They are as valuable as lighthouses, as they are a useful tool for locating information and navigating throughout the book, which go unnoticed in the page during reading. It is the line which appears on the head margin of the pages and which are not the headlines of the chapters. It may include the title of the book, of a part, chapter, section or any other reference. It is frequently combined with the page numbers, sharing the same line.</p>
<h5>Main Text</h5>
<p>Printed material which will be part of all the pages of the book, it is the fundamental element of the designer’s work which will help him decide about the layout, typeface families, variables, edition length, etc.</p>
<h5>Type case</h5>
<p>It is the area of the grid where the printed area is.</p>
<h5>Quotes</h5>
<p>Some authors abundantly use other author’s quotes, both in prose texts as well as in poems. The reader needs to see that there is a change from the main text to the quotes, and then go on reading normally.</p>
<p>How quotes are treated depends on their nature, importance and frequency of appearance throughout the piece. They may be marginal quotes or footnotes, but may also be put together at the end of the chapter or edition; for this it is necessary to analyze their frequency of appearance.</p>
<h5>Page number</h5>
<p>Numbering of a book’s pages, they have similar typographic characteristics to those used in the text, and are generally placed outside the type case.</p>
<h5>Final pages</h5>
<p>The right order of the final pages should be: appendixes, notes, abbreviations, glossaries, bibliography, acknowledgments, table of contents and colophon; though this is the correct arrangement almost exclusively in academic editions.</p>
<h5>Epigraph</h5>
<p>It is text which adds data about what may be seen in an image (picture, illustration, etc.).</p>
<h5>Notes</h5>
<p>They are footnotes at the end of a page, chapter or at the end of the book.</p>
<h5>Glossary</h5>
<p>Small dictionary of the edition.</p>
<h5>Bibliography</h5>
<p>List of recommended readings.</p>
<h5>Colophon</h5>
<p>A page is included at the end of the book, to mention where and when it has been printed. It includes the name of the printing shop, its address and date of publishing. Sometimes some information as to special publishing circumstances is added.</p>

<blockquote><p>«Since Gutenberg, typography has worked with fixed rules that apply to the configuration of printed pieces. (…) Typographic rules refer not only to the distance between letters and between words, to leading, to type of letters, etc, but also to the setting of proportions for the type page, of columns, margins and page format. (…)» <cite>Josef Müller-Brockmann</cite></p></blockquote>
<h3>Proportion</h3>

(Real Academia Española, 2001, 22º ed.).</p>
<p>Human activity has shown a tendency to order since ancient times. The desire to organize the multiple and diverse characteristics of phenomena and things, is a need deeply rooted in the human race. </p>
<p>Pythagoras (580-500 B.C.) taught that simple numbers and their reciprocal relations, as well as simple geometrical figures represent the intimate secret of nature. </p>
<p>The Greeks also found the relations of the divine proportion and demonstrated that these may be found in human bodies and artists and architects based their pieces of work on them. During the Renaissance, artists recognized the principle of their compositions in measurement and proportions, by studying and applying mathematics and geometry. </p>
<p>Philosophers, architects, and artists from Pythagoras, Vitruvius, Durer, to Le Corbusier, elaborated their theories based on proportion, in which they express the ideas of their times.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>We will review a series of relations that will allow us to establish proportions in our work, beginning from the format of the substrate: </p>
<h3>ISO 216</h3>
<p>Iso 216 The first effort to normalize the commercialization format of paper was the din system (J. C. Lichtenberg, 1742-1799) which tried to combine the esthetic with the useful. Thus he took a rectangle with proportions which are repeated in all submultiples (1: root of 2) and modulated it according to the metric system.</p>
<p>This rectangle 1: root -2 is constructed like this: Given a square (a b c d) one of its sides is prolonged (a b). Standing on one of its vortexes (a) one lets de diagonal drop until it intercepts the prolonged side (a b). This point will be the new vortex of the rectangle. This proportion is equivalent to the irrational number 1.41414… </p>
<p>This rectangle has the peculiarity that when it is divided in two identical rectangles with a line parallel to the shorter side, the resulting rectangles preserve the proportion 1: root of 2. </p>
<p>To make the use of Iso 216 more practical, the basic rectangle was built with a surface of 1m2. This basic rectangle is called A0 and its dimensions are: 0.841 m x 1.189 m.<br />

</p>
<p>When dividing it, we obtain the A1 rectangle, dividing this one, we obtain A2 and so on, and thus we obtain all the rectangles for the A series. </p>
<p>These Iso 216 formats (as din formats are called today) have been adopted by many countries that manufacture their papers with approximately 20mm surplus, to preserve the A series as a final format. They are practical to use because of how they behave as regards proportional reductions and enlargements. For instance a double vertical A4 page (in total, a horizontal A3) can be reduced to 70.71% to become a horizontal A4.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that many pieces are produced according to this normalization (envelopes, folders, files, cards, etc.) which allows for a simple coexistence of pieces of different origin. In spite of the advantages of the Iso 216 formats, one problem is that they do not relate to type size, but the worse obstacle is the designers’ resistance to use them, as they consider them monotonous, inflexible or of little esthetical value. </p>
<p>From manuscript to modern times many formats have been used. Some of them are really simple, like the square or rectangle formed by the double square (1:2) and some are more complex, especially when related with the composed type page, such as:</p>
<h4>Golden section</h4>
<p>Magic qualities have been attributed to this system of proportions. It has been repeatedly used in arts and architecture of all times, but it also appears in natural progressions like leaf veins, tree branches, snails, etc. </p>
<p>The golden number is the irrational 1.61803…, quotient of (1+ root of 5) /2. Its graphic construction is simple:<br />
We start by drawing a square (a b c d) and dividing it in two equal rectangles (a e f d, e b c f). A diagonal is drawn (e c); taking e as a center, we let the diagonal drop until cutting the prolongation of a b, this point (p) determines the long side of the golden rectangle. </p>
<p>We can achieve this same proportion through the Fibonacci series where from the third on, each member is the sum of the two previous ones: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55… </p>
<p>If we divide two consecutive members (higher and lesser) the quotient is close to the golden number: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etcétera.</p>
<p>Si se dividen dos miembros consecutivos (mayor/menor) de esta serie, el cociente se aproxima al número de oro:</p>
<p>2 / 1 = 2</p>
<p>3 / 2 = 1,5</p>
<p>5 / 3 = 1,667</p>
<p>13 / 8 = 1,625</p>
<p>21 / 13 = 1,615</p>
<p>34 / 21 = 1,619</p>
<p>55 / 35 = 1,618</p>
<h4>Ternary rectangle and others</h4>
<p>The ternary is a 2&#215;3 figure. When dividing it transversally in halves, ternary rectangles generate two rectangles in a 3:4 proportion, and the same happens when two rectangles of a 2:3 proportion are put together by their long side. Consecutive divisions throw as a result:<br />
2:3; 3:4; 2:3; 3:4…</p>
<p>From these historically recognized proportions or from other new proportions we might define the format of our work, but we have still to define the grey rectangle (text smear) and its position in the page. </p>
<p>Apart from esthetical considerations, there are some functional considerations we cannot avoid when choosing the size of the text smear because they have an influence on reading.</p>
<h3>Number of characters per line</h3>
<p>There is no absolute consensus as to this number. For instance for J. Müller-Brockmann, the optimal length of a line is an average of 10 words per line in long texts or 7 words for texts of any length. Emil Ruder says that a line of 50 to 60 letters is easy to read. For Robert Bringhurst, in single column compositions, the ideal line contains 66 characters, with a minimum of 45 and a maximum of 75. In compositions with more than one column the range is between 45 and 60 characters. It also admits longer lines of 85 to 90 characters if the text is well composed, with wide leading or when it is auxiliary information, like foot notes. </p>
<p>There is also an arithmetic calculation: A line with the 26 simple letters of the alphabet is composed, its length will be called lca (length of characters of the alphabet), the optimal number of characters (l) is obtained applying the following formula: l = lca x 1.75 </p>
<p>From this dimension we can obtain others, for instance, we will call the maximum line length m and the minimum line length n. Then, we may calculate:<br />
n = l x 0,75 m = l x 1,5<br />
This is the same as saying that the lines will have more than 34.1 letters and less than 67.5, and that an optimal line will have 45.5 characters. </p>
<p>To calculate the width of the type page or columns has an incidence on costs and piece size, but also on reading. </p>
<p>When the reader finishes a line, he receives a stimulus, when the line is too wide, this stimulus is scarce and it becomes arduous to read. If, on the other hand, the line is too narrow, the reader has to move his eyes continuously from side to side. </p>
<p>Variations between the minimum, the optimal and the maximum widths and the leading allow us to test which is the best relation we can obtain between comfortable reading, esthetics and costs.</p>
<div id="attachment_1446" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 710px"><a href="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/T04A_03-bloque_colorlectura.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1446" title="Bloque de texto, color y comodidad de lectura" src="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/T04A_03-bloque_colorlectura.jpg" alt="Bloque de texto, color y comodidad de lectura" width="700" height="526" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">1: Cantidad mínima de caracteres por línea (las líneas 3, 4 y 10 no presentan un color de texto parejo). 2: cantidad óptima, lectura confortable y buen color. 3: al límite del largo de línea, muy buen color pero lectura no muy cómoda.</p></div>
<h3>Typographic factor</h3>
<p>Typographic catalogs included typographic factor tables for each typeface family and type size. This typographic factor is the number of characters that fit in a certain unit of measurement. This typographic factor, multiplied by the width of the type page gives us a good approximation as to how many characters will fit per line including spaces. </p>
<p>Thus we may relate a typographic factor of a certain family and the type size (performance) with the width of the type page to achieve comfortable reading values. We know that if we cannot change family and type size, we may modify the width of the type page, or vice versa, change family and type size if we cannot modify the width of the type page. After making this choice we will have to find the optimal leading for that typeface family composed in lines with that length.</p>
<h3>Columns</h3>
<p>Columns should not be devised as an esthetical resource but as an efficient tool for the treatment of texts. For instance, in large formats they allow us to work with small type sizes without tiring the reader. </p>
<p>If we remember how the process of reading takes place, recognizing group of words, we will see that columns interrupt the perception of the whole phrase, and the narrower the columns, the worse. On the other hand, if the text is justified, compensation of color in narrower columns is more complex, because they have less space between words. We have already seen that is almost impossible to achieve justified blocks of text with good color if we do not use an efficient and controlled separation into syllables, where not many successive word cuts are repeated so as not to reduce block color with hyphens, and at the same time, without producing open lines because of characters missing in the line.  Columns set flush left and with a fray to the right preserve the same space between words, but we have to control the fray by cutting excessively long words so that the right margin is not too irregular.</p>
<h3>Margins</h3>
<p>There are many interpretations for blank spaces. In some cultures, it is a synonym of emptiness, of waste, in others, instead, it is synonym of light, a valuable form enhancer, an active and indispensable surface for the perception of the form. </p>
<p>But again, margin consideration is not merely esthetic, but also functional and economic. Margins have been reduced through time for economic reasons, when trying to obtain the best possible use of paper, but this has its limits. </p>
<p>Margins fulfill specific tasks that can be summarized as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>To regulate visual weight of the printed area in the page.</li>
<li>To avoid loosing part of the text in the edge cutting (variation from 1mm to 3 mm).</li>
<li>To leave a surface free of text in order to manipulate the page comfortably, (especially in external margins).</li>
<li>To avoid bookbinding from obstructing reading (especially in gutter margins).</li>
</ul>
<p>As to this, it is convenient to ask first about the page design, because based on the type of binding used, different effects will be obtained. </p>
<p>In a binding at the fold (booklet formed by sheets set into a pile on a trestle to be sewn with a thread or clamps) paper accumulates in the spine, as much as half the thickness of the edition (for example, if the edition is 4 mm thick, 2 mm accumulate in the spine). This accumulation affects each page in a different way, depending on the place it occupies in the booklet. </p>
<p>According to the example above, central pages will have their cut margins 2 mm narrower than the booklet’s external pages. </p>
<p>It could also happen that the binding of this edition were of the binder type, where sheets and cover are glued together in the spine in a single operation. As these sheets are not sewn, the glues used tend to be strong and hard, resulting in a rigid spine that tends to close. Sometimes, if this edition is forced to open wider, the spine may break. In books bound using this method, we should keep in mind that the gutter margin will be reduced, making visualization of this area quite difficult. </p>
<p>Finally, there are esthetic and stylistic arguments we should consider. In many manuscripts and incunabula the text used to occupy 45 to 50% of the page, despite the high costs of paper or parchment. In contrast, nowadays, the surface of the printed paper, in many cases, exceeds 75% of the page. We should know that a harmonic page encourages reading because it is not tiring and this harmony is given by the sum of all factors reviewed up to now: format, width of the type page, and the relation between both: margins.</p>
<h3>Relation page/printed area</h3>
<p>We will now study some resources to control these relations which have been classically used to place the typographic rectangle out of the center of the page. It is intended to fulfill four basic rules that give them harmony: </p>
<ol>
<li>1. The diagonal of the case should coincide with the diagonal of the page.</li>
<li>The height of the case should be the same as width of the page.</li>
<li>The fore-edge (or outer margin) should double the inside margin (or gutter margin).</li>
<li>The top margin (or head margin) should be half the bottom one (or foot margin). This rule results from the 3 previous ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules generate harmony, because the printed area and the page have the same proportions and the upper thirds in the two figures rest on the same line. The fact that the printed area is placed slightly high and to one side makes it lighter and more dynamic than if it were placed statically in the center of the page. </p>
<p>We will now review other methods used throughout history to relate page and printed area:</p>
<h4>Diagonal method</h4>
<p>It comes from applying only the first classical rule: that the diagonal of the page and the diagonal of the typographic rectangle coincide. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/T04A_05-pagina_armonica.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1799" title="Método de la diagonal y Sistema normalizado ISO 216" src="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/T04A_05-pagina_armonica.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="526" /></a></p>
<h4>Double diagonal</h4>
<p>If we complete the previous system by drawing the diagonal of the spread double page (d2) we come up with an interesting solution. On the diagonal of the page (d), we arbitrarily mark the top left corner (a) which will determine the top and the outer margins, from there we will draw a horizontal line until finding the double page diagonal (b), obtaining the external margin. </p>
<p>From b we will draw the vertical h until intercepting d1, obtaining the bottom margin. When this system applies to golden proportion or golden approximation formats (two consecutive numbers of the Fibonacci series) it is called golden section or relation. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/T04A_06-doblediagonal_normalizado.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1791" title="Método de la diagonal" src="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/T04A_06-doblediagonal_normalizado.jpg" alt="Método de la diagonal" width="700" height="526" /></a></p>
<h4>Normalized Iso 216 system</h4>
<p>When the 4 rules are applied on an iso series format, the resulting printed area has the dimensions of the following series format. That is to say, if the page is A4, the case will be A5. </p>
<h4>Ternary Canon</h4>
<p>If the page has a 2:3 proportion and the 4 rules are applied, the following relation is produced: the bottom margin is equal to the sum of the lateral margins. This relation was used in many medieval manuscripts. It is also known as secret canon and was divulged by Jan Tschichold in 1953.<br />
<a href="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/T04A_07-canon_ternario.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1792" title="Canon ternario" src="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/T04A_07-canon_ternario.jpg" alt="Canon ternario" width="700" height="526" /></a></p>
<p>The Argentinean Raúl Rosarivo (1903-1966) widely studied this method after he found it in Gutenberg’s 42 line Bible. In the case of the Bible, printed with this method, the page is divided vertically and horizontally in 9 parts, producing 81 2:3 proportion rectangles (same as the page). Only 36 of these rectangles are occupied by the printed page, divided in two columns by a broad river. </p>
<p>The width of this separation is equal to 1/9 of the width of the type case, therefore the text of this edition occupies 39.51% of the surface of the sheet. </p>
<h4>Universal scale</h4>
<p>This method was developed by Rosarivo, it consists of dividing the page in the same number of horizontal and vertical sections, which should be multiples of 3. Once the division of a vertical has been made a vertical module is used for the gutter margin, a horizontal one for the head margin and two for the bottom margin. Margin’s width turn out to be inversely proportional to the number of divisions. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/T04A_09-escalauniversal.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1793" title="Escala universal" src="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/T04A_09-escalauniversal.jpg" alt="Escala universal" width="700" height="526" /></a></p>
<h4>System 2-3-4-6</h4>
<p>The numbers correspond to the relation between margins and derive from the ternary canon. Using this method, we try to fulfill rules 3 and 4, but not necessarily the 2 first rules. It is a quick method to make margins proportional: the unit is given any value and then that number is multiplied by 2, 3, 4, and 6 to find outer, head, gutter and foot margins respectively. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/T04A_11-sistema_2-3-4-6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1794" title="Sistema 2-3-4-6" src="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/T04A_11-sistema_2-3-4-6.jpg" alt="Sistema 2-3-4-6" width="700" height="526" /></a></p>
<h4>Van der Graaf method</h4>
<p>It is useful to find the page’s 9ths in a graphic, not an arithmetical manner. In order to do this, the 6 diagonals of the double page are drawn. From point a, a diagonal is raised up to the upper border of the paper. From there, a straight line is drawn until the intersection of b in the other page. In the point where this straight line crosses the diagonal d1, the left upper vertex of the text is determined. This method is the same as dividing the height and width of the page in 9ths and distributing the margins according to the ternary canon (1/9 for the narrower ones and 2/9 for the wider ones).</p>

<h4>Inverted margins</h4>
<p>The decision of having a narrow gutter margin in the spine, resulting from margins which are half as narrow as the outer margins, can bring about some problems depending to the type of binding used. To avoid these problems, we can invert the relation leaving the wide margins in the center of the piece.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/T04A_10-margenes_invertidos.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1796" title="Márgenes invertidos" src="http://www.oert.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/T04A_10-margenes_invertidos.jpg" alt="Márgenes invertidos" width="700" height="526" /></a></p>
<p>In books with good spine opening this will create a separation of the printed areas in the double page which should be taken into consideration and studied in each case.</p>
<h4>Arbitrary margins</h4>
<p>Tschichold says: «The tasks of the book designer and of the graphic artist are essentially different, while the latter is in constant search for new means of expression, pushed to an extreme by his desire to find a personal style, the book designer must be a loyal and discrete slave of the written word. […] Book designing is not a field for those who want to invent the ’style of the moment&#8217; or to create something ‘new&#8217;». </p>
<p>We must understand what Tschichold says in the field of text book design, knowing that «artistic books» or non conventional books should be treated differently and using other design concepts which consider their particular features, so as to obtain the best possible transmission of contents and manner of reading. </p>
<p>The use of arbitrary margins should be taken into consideration for short text pieces, of quick reading or for pieces of non continuous texts, such as brochures, advertisements, poems, dictionaries, directories, etc., where though attention should be put to margins, other criteria may be used for setting them , always keeping in mind the 4 points mentioned at the beginning:<br />
Avoid loosing text when edge cutting the paper; leave some free space in order to grab the printed material without covering the text with our hands; avoid possible inaccuracies of the print run, and avoid the binding from making reading the text in the spine difficult. </p>
