(Traducción del castellano: Selene Brazon)




You can participate in two ways: as a user (reading and/or solving exercises) or as an author (commenting in already published articles, or sending in new ones).




When you comment on an article, this will be sent to: [info@oert.org](mailto:info@oert.org), and after it is approved by the editorial committee, it will be published under the sender’s authorship.




To publish new articles, you must send [info@oert.org](mailto:info@oert.org) an email which contains the article’s abstract (up to 500 characters, with spaces), and the completed version (including illustrations, with no length restriction). After it is approved by the editorial committee, it will be published under the sender’s authorship.
