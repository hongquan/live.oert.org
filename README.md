The official development of the Open Educational Resources for Typography project happens here. 

To learn about the project, please see www.oert.org and the [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cosgaya/oert-open-educational-resources-for-typography) that launched the project.

OERT is dedicated to publishing high quality education resources for typography, so the contents of the main site is updated once per year after ensuring all the information that is developed collaboratively here is valid and correct.

The OERT website is made with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
